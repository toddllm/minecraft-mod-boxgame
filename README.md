# Trap Platform Mod - The Arena of Fear

**Trap Platform** is a Minecraft Fabric mod (1.21) that introduces a chaotic, wave-based arena survival minigame. Players are trapped on a small platform and must survive an onslaught of deadly traps, mobs, and environmental hazards controlled by an ominous entity known as **The Box**.

## Features

### 🏟️ The Arena
- **Teleportation**: Use the `Arena Teleporter` item (automatically given on join/respawn) to instantly warp to the arena dimension.
- **The Platform**: A 5x5 obsidian platform floating in the void.
- **The Box**: A floating, glowing Crying Obsidian entity that watches over the arena and attacks players with **Rings of Evoker Fangs**.

### 🌊 Wave System
- **Survival**: Survive endless waves of traps triggered every 15 seconds.
- **Cleanup**: The arena is automatically cleaned of mobs and projectiles between waves.
- **Shrinking Circle**: At the start of every wave, a massive wall of Evoker Fangs closes in from the edges, forcing you to the center.

### 🪤 Traps (38+ Varieties)
The mod features a massive collection of traps that trigger randomly:
- **Elemental**: Lightning Storms, Fireball Rain, Anvil Rain, TNT Rain, Lava Pools.
- **Mob Hordes**: Zombie Hordes, Skeleton Snipers, Wither Skeletons, Strays, Husks, Drowned.
- **Elites**: Piglin Brutes, Vindicators, Pillagers, Witches, Ravagers.

- **Special**: Web Traps, Levitation, Nausea, Blindness.

### 💀 Progression & The Boss
As you survive waves, the Overworld changes to reveal the true nature of your enemy.
- **The Mystery**: A burning **"F"** structure generates near spawn.
- **Wave 5**: A burning **"E"** appears.
- **Wave 10**: A burning **"A"** appears.
- **Wave 15**: A burning **"R"** appears, completing the name **"FEAR"**.

### 👹 The Final Boss: FEAR
Upon reaching Wave 15, the true boss is unleashed in the Overworld.
- **Name**: **FEAR**
- **Type**: An **Evoker** riding a **Ravager** ("The Beast of Fear").
- **Powers**:
    - **Eternal Storm**: Summons a permanent thunderstorm and midnight darkness.
    - **Fire & Lava**: Rains down Large Fireballs and creates Lava pools.
